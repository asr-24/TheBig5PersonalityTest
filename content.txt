Researchers have found that there is a science to personality. Every single person–regardless of gender, age or nationality — is made up of 5 basic traits.

Openness
Conscientiousness
Extroversion
Agreeableness
Neuroticism

Fondly known as the Big 5 Personality Traits, or OCEAN, these are incredibly helpful for understanding yourself. When you understand your own personality, you are able to ask for your needs, connect more easily, and optimize your behavior. Read on or watch the video to figure out where you fall on the personality spectrum.

Is Your Personality Genetic?
Is your personality nature or nurture? Did you inherit your traits from your parents or create them in your childhood? The answer is…both.

Our personalities are complicated, multi-dimensional beasts. Based on four different twin studies, researchers believe certain traits are more heritable than others. For example, how adventurous you are is the most heritable trait, while how easy going you are is the least heritable. In other words, if your parents love trying new foods, you are more likely to enjoy that as well. But if your parents are laid-back hippies, you have less of a chance of being a hippie.

Here is an overview of the 5 traits and how ‘heritable’ they are.

Personality Trait #1: Openness
Openness is when someone is curious and openminded to new experiences and knowledge. People who rate high in openness are inventive and curious. People who rate low in openness are consistent and cautious. Do you agree or disagree with these statements?

I love adventure.
I am imaginative.
I am the first to try new activities.
If you agreed, you probably rate high in openness. If you disagreed, you probably rate low in openness.

Openness has 57% genetic influence
Special Note: If you rate high in openness, let people in your life know that you love to be challenged. Make sure you have creative outlets to express yourself. You also have to make sure your spouse or partner knows your level of adventure, so your needs are met.

Personality Trait #2: Conscientiousness
Conscientiousness describes how organized and dependable you are. People who rate high in conscientiousness are efficient and organized. People who rate low in conscientiousness are more easy-going and laid back. Do you agree or disagree with these statements?

I am highly self-disciplined.
I am very organized and always come prepared.
I like to know the plan rather than be spontaneous.
If you agreed, you probably rate high in conscientiousness. If you disagreed, you probably rate low in conscientiousness.

Conscientiousness has 49% genetic influence
Special Note: If you rate high in conscientiousness, you want to make sure the people around you respect your desire to have a plan. But don’t get too frustrated with people who rate low in conscientiousness–you can’t blame them for not being organized. It just doesn’t come as naturally.

Personality Trait #3: Extroversion
Extroversion describes how you interact with people. People who rate high in extroversion are outgoing and energetic. People who rate low in extroversion are more solitary and reserved. Do you agree or disagree with these statements?

I am the life of the party.
I don’t mind being the center of attention.
I am usually the one to start a conversation with someone.
If you agreed, you probably rate high in extroversion. If you disagreed, you probably rate low in extroversion.

Extraversion has 54% genetic influence
Special Note: If you rate low in extroversion, be sure to not force yourself to try being extroverted. Honor your introversion. You never want to try being something or someone you are not. Think of the places and people who get you excited and stick to those nourishing spots. This helps you stay true to yourself–let the extroverts go to the nightclubs!

Personality Trait #4: Agreeableness
Agreeableness is how you feel toward others. People who rate high in agreeableness are friendly and compassionate. People who rate low in agreeableness are more analytical and detached. Do you agree or disagree with these statements?

I tend to trust people and give them the benefit of the doubt.
I am extremely empathetic.
I like to make other people feel at ease.
If you agreed, you rate probably high in agreeableness. If you disagreed, you rate probably low in agreeableness.

Agreeableness has 42% genetic influence
Special Note: If you rate low in agreeableness, empathy doesn’t come as naturally to you. So, your partner might say things such as, ‘Don’t you understand me?’ or, ‘Why don’t you get me?’ That’s okay. Know that you have to make more of a mental effort to put yourself in their shoes.

Personality Trait #5: Neuroticism
Neuroticism is how you deal with emotions. People who rate high in neuroticism are sensitive and tend to be more nervous. People who rate low in neuroticism tend to be more secure and stable. Do you agree or disagree with these statements?

I stress out easily.
I tend to be moody.
I am a worrier.
If you agreed, you probably rate high in neuroticism. If you disagreed, you probably rate low in neuroticism.

Neuroticism has 48% genetic influence
Special Note: If you rate high in neuroticism, you have to know your triggers–what makes you worry? And your calmers–what helps you calm down? So you can be more in control of your moods.

There are some other fascinating facts about personality science that might intrigue you.

How Your Personality Traits Affect Your Lifespan
1. Conscientiousness
A 75-year longitudinal study conducted by Joshua Jackson (no relation to Jonathan Jackson that I know of), determined that men with conscientious personality traits have been known to live longer.

Conscientiousness is the trait that describes how organized and dependable you are. People high in this trait have high self-discipline, are very organized and prepared and like to plan things out instead of being spontaneous.

This makes sense when you think about it. High-conscientious men would be less likely to do something spontaneous and potentially life-threatening. Further, being dependable and strict with self-discipline is a much safer lifestyle choice.

2. Extroversion
Extroversion describes how you interact with people. People who are high in extroversion (extroverts) are outgoing and energetic, while people who are low in extroversion (introverts) are more solitary and reserved, and typically require recharge time from social interaction. As it turns out, people who are more outgoing and sociable have the strongest immune system, compared to those who are more introspective and introverted.

Bonus: Think you may fall somewhere in the middle? You may be an Ambivert!

To test this, participants in a recent study had blood samples taken for measuring genetic factors and their immune system. They were then given a personality test to see where they fall on the Big 5 spectrum. Those who were labeled as extroverted appeared to have immune systems strong enough to deal with their socially oriented nature, where introverts had weaker ones.

This study proves that the bodies of extroverted people are primed to have stronger immune systems since they are more exposed to germs or sickness as they interact with more people on a regular basis.

3. Agreeableness
Agreeableness is how you feel towards others. People who are high in agreeableness are friendly, compassionate and very optimistic–they are collaborative and team-players. Research has shown that people high in agreeableness and optimism have healthier hearts than those who are pessimistic or neurotic.

Even when adjusted to include socio-demographic characteristics like age, income, education and poor mental health, the results remained consistent: agreeable, optimistic people had better cardiovascular health. Not only that, but they were less stressed, had a healthier body mass index and were less likely to smoke–all of which are major factors that can affect your heart health.

Highly agreeable people are better at using coping strategies and because they are naturally more empathetic and compassionate, they’re also more likely to reach out for support when in need and help others.

Not high in these traits? Don’t worry! Even if you’re not high in these three specific personality traits, it does not mean you won’t live a long and healthy life. There are benefits for each trait no matter where you fall on the spectrum.
